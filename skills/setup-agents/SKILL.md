# /setup-agents

Scaffold a complete multi-agent Claude Code development system for the current project.

This skill runs an 8-step configuration dialogue, then delegates generation to the `system-architect` agent. Nothing is written until you confirm in Step 8.

---

## Step 1 — Read the Project

Search the current directory for project files in this order:

**Primary (preferred):**
- `vision.md`
- `tech-stack.md`

**Fallback (if primary not found):**
- `README.md`
- `package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `package-lock.json`
- `Cargo.toml`
- `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`
- `go.mod`
- `Gemfile`
- Root-level `*.config.ts`, `*.config.js`

Extract: project name, type, primary languages, frameworks, database/storage, AI/ML components, testing frameworks, CI/CD setup, package manager, team size (if mentioned).

Present a confirmation summary and wait for the user to confirm or correct before proceeding.

---

## Step 2 — Development Approach

Based on the project context from Step 1, suggest a development approach. Present all 5 options with a recommended pick:

| Signal | Suggested approach |
|--------|--------------------|
| Solo developer, small project | Iterative + Timeboxing |
| Team project, existing CI/CD | Trunk-Based |
| Product with deadlines | Shape Up |
| Greenfield, unclear scope | Iterative + Timeboxing |
| Library/OSS | TDD-First |

**Available approaches:**
1. **Iterative + Timeboxing** — Ship working increments every 1-3 days. Each cycle has a tangible deliverable.
2. **Shape Up** — 6-week build cycles, 2-week cooldown. Appetites, not estimates.
3. **TDD-First** — Tests before implementation. Coverage is the primary quality signal.
4. **Trunk-Based** — Single main branch, short-lived branches, feature flags.
5. **YAGNI/KISS** — Build the minimum. Refactor only on second similar case.

The developer selects exactly one approach. Save the selection as `{{approach}}` in the confirmed configuration. The selected approach will generate a "Development Approach" section in the project's CLAUDE.md.

If the developer wants to skip approach selection, proceed without it — the approach section will not be generated.

---

## Step 3 — Agents

Based on the detected stack, propose specialized agents. Rules:

- **opus** for safety-critical domains: backend logic, database, AI/ML pipelines, infrastructure
- **sonnet** for high-iteration domains: frontend/UI, testing, CI/CD, documentation
- Assign a **color** to each agent using semantic conventions: `blue`/`cyan` for analysis/review, `green` for success-oriented, `yellow` for caution/validation, `red` for critical/security, `magenta` for creative/generation
- Each agent must have a clearly defined domain and explicit forbidden zones
- Always include a `testing` agent
- A `dispatch` agent is always generated automatically for the orchestration pipeline — do not include it in the proposals
- Minimum 2 agents, maximum 8

Present proposals and wait for the user to add, remove, or rename before proceeding.

---

## Step 4 — Skills

Always include the standard set. Add stack-specific skills when relevant tooling is detected.

**Standard (always):**
- `/check` — full quality pipeline (lint + typecheck + tests)
- `/changelog` — session changelog from git diff
- `/phase` — phase-level feature executor (backward-compat wrapper)
- `/deploy-check` — pre-deployment audit
- `/plan` — plan a feature: decompose into tasks with domain assignments
- `/dispatch` — assign agents and skills to a plan's tasks
- `/execute` — execute an approved dispatch plan task by task
- `/docs` — maintain documentation coverage: audit components, update docs, check status

**Stack-specific examples:**
- `/migrate` — if Prisma, Drizzle, Alembic, or similar detected
- `/e2e` — if Playwright, Cypress, or Puppeteer detected
- `/container` — if Docker/docker-compose detected
- `/infra` — if Terraform, Pulumi, or CDK detected

Present the full list with checkboxes and wait for confirmation.

---

## Step 5 — Plugins

**Context7 is always enabled. Non-negotiable.**

Delegate to the `system-architect` agent: pass it the detected tech stack from Steps 1–4 and ask it to use Context7 (`resolve-library-id` → `query-docs`) to verify current best practices and return plugin recommendations. Do not perform Context7 lookups directly from the skill — this is analysis work that belongs to the agent.

Once the agent returns its recommendations, present them to the user. Always include:
- `context7` — mandatory for all projects

Default recommendations based on detected stack:
- `typescript-lsp` — if TypeScript detected
- `rust-analyzer-lsp` — if Cargo.toml detected
- `github` — if GitHub remote detected
- `playwright` — if Playwright in dependencies
- `code-simplifier` — always recommended

Present with checkboxes and wait for confirmation.

---

## Step 6 — Hooks

Detect the primary linter/formatter:
- TypeScript → Biome or ESLint (check config files)
- Rust → Clippy (`cargo clippy`)
- Python → Ruff or Black
- Go → `gofmt`

Propose:

**PostToolUse** (after every file edit): run linter on `$CLAUDE_FILE_PATH`
**Stop** (end of session): scan for hardcoded secrets and unsafe patterns

Present the proposed commands and wait for the user to modify or add custom hooks.

---

## Step 7 — Permissions

Pre-fill based on detected package manager and tools. Always include:

**Allow:**
- `Bash(git:*)`
- `Bash(gh pr:*)`
- `Bash(<package-manager>:*)` — detected package manager
- `Bash(make:*)` — if Makefile detected

**Deny (secrets protection — always):**
- `Read(.env)`
- `Read(.env.*)`
- `Read(secrets/**)`
- `Read(~/.ssh/**)`
- `Write(.env)`
- `Write(.env.*)`

Ask if there are additional commands to allow (docker, terraform, aws, kubectl, etc.) and wait for response.

---

## Step 8 — Final Confirmation

Present the complete system summary in a single block covering: selected approach, all agents (including dispatch and docs), all skills (including plan/dispatch/execute/docs), plugins, hooks, and permissions.

Include a brief description of the development workflow:
> After generation, use `/plan` to start a feature, `/dispatch` to assign agents, and `/execute` to run the plan. All artifacts are saved in `docs/plans/`.

Ask:

```
Generate this system into the current repo? [yes / change]
```

- If **yes**: delegate to the `system-architect` agent with the full confirmed configuration (including `approach` if selected)
- If **change**: return to the relevant step

Do not write any files until this confirmation is received.
